  <h3>Design a site for a small business</h3>
  <p>Your second project is to design a site for a small business. We have broken down, analyzed, and worked on something similar <a href="/class/alonsos-3/">in class</a>. These are the requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Yes it must be a real business that exists now.</li>
    <li>You may redesign a site or create a site from scratch if the business does not have one</li>
    <li>Businesses shouldn't</li>
    <li>You must take into account everything we have learned so far.</li>
    <li>You must use the normalize.css from the boilerplate we created</li>
    <li>You must use a font from <a href="http://google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> in your design that is appropriate for the business and matches its brand</li>
    <li>Your CSS should be in its own separate CSS file.</li>
    <li>Make your resume fluid to scale and look good on devices of all sizes</li>
    <li>This site may have multiple pages but it shouldn't be too large for the scope of this project</li>
    <li>The site should include a similar navigation structur on each page</li>
    <li>Include the logo of the business</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Other things to consider:</h3>
