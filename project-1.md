  <h3>Design an HTML version of your resume</h3>
  <p>Your first project will be to create a one page HTML version of your resume. These are the requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Yes it must be your real, complete resume as you'd send to a potential employer.</li>
    <li>You must take into account everything we have learned so far.</li>
    <li>You must use the normalize.css from the boilerplate we created</li>
    <li>You must use a font from <a href="http://google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> in your design that is appropriate to be on your resume</li>
    <li>Your CSS should be in its own separate CSS file.</li>
    <li>You may include a picture of yourself if you'd like but you don't have to.</li>
    <li>If you're uncomfortable including your mailing address or phone number you may leave it out but you must include at least your email address (as a clickable link) as a form of contact</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Other things to consider:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Font size</li>
  <li>Line spacing</li>
  <li>Measure (characters per line)</li>
  <li>Colors</li>
</ul>


<h3>Potential for bonus points:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make your resume fluid to scale and look good on devices of all sizes</li>
<li>Going above and beyond the previously stated requirements</li>
</ul>


<h3>The following will reflect on your grade poorly:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Not putting any thought or time into this project</li>
<li>Using table based layouts</li>
<li>Using deprecated HTML such as &lt;font>, &lt;center></li>
<li>Using styles inline. don't do this: <code>&lt;h1 style="margin-bottom:3em;"></code></li>
<li>Grammatical errors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>The link to your resume must be emailed to me.  It should be located at http://yourdomainname.com/class/resume/index.html</p>
